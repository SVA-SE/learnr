# Brief description

These data are a subset of 16 herds from a dataset collected by Jette
Christensen in Denmark to study factors affecting preweaning mortality
in pigs. These data have three levels in the hierarchy
(litters(n=6552) within sows (n=3162) within farms(n=16)):

The key outcome of interest is preweaning mortality with a litter
classified as having preweaning mortality or not if one or more
piglets died before weaning.
