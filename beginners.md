## Learning obejctives

This course will teach you the basics of data management and  analysis in R. We will
teach the following concepts:

* What is data in R? Why isn't it just a spreadsheet like in Stata?
    * Dataframes, vectors, lists and more! 
* How to open data in R from other software
    * Stata, SAS, excel, .csv
* Basic data cleaning and manipulation
    * Merging, appending
	* corrections to data
	* Generating new variables in a dataset
* Implimenting and interpreting the output from basic statistical tests
and models in R.
	* How does the output compare to Stata's output?
* Plotting in R
	* Generating plots using base plotting and ggplot2
	* Mapping in R, point maps, riskmaps, spatiotemporal map movies

## Prerequisites (150 words)

Interest in learning to use R! We will use examples that are related
to data summary analysis and plotting in veterinary
epidemiology. Therefore we expect that you have a knowledge of basic
statistics. 


## Target audicience

You are a person who deals with data managment and data analysis.

We expect that you have either:

* never used R before
* use R for specific tasks that are not possible in Stata, SAS or Excel but
you prefer to work in one of those software.

This course is for epidemiologists and students in epidemiology that
would like to incorporte R into their work.

## History of workshop

- This will be the first time this workshop is being offered. We have
  given a similar format course on the use of R at the Swedish veterinary institute (SVA).
