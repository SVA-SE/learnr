# Finding and reading R documentation

Finding, reading and understanding the documentation of R can seem
like an impossible task even when you have been using the software for
some time. The most important source of documentation is the help from
within R itself.

## From R

In the R console type:

`help("Name of the function")`

and the documentation for that function will popup in a browser.


## From R-studio

On the bottom right quadrant of the software you have the tabs "Files",
"Plots", "Packages", "Help" and "Viewer". In the "Help" tab you can
search for the documentation of a function by entering its name in the
search field.


## Reading the documentation

The documentation of a function is broken into parts:

* A title
* Description
    * This is sometimes lots of information and sometimes very
      little. It essentially gives you some explanation of what the
      function does and what it is good for.
* Arguments
    * A list of all of the required arguments to the function and a
      description of each of them.
* Examples
    * Some examples that the author has written to illustrate the
      function's use. This is often the place that you can quickly
      gain understanding of what a function is for and how to use it.
	  You should be able to run the examples by copying the code into
      the R console. The you can explore the data that is input to the
      function and the output. Then if you are going to use the
      function on your own data you know how to structure it.

## Other documentation

### Vignettes

Vignettes are web pages or pdf documents that give more exhaustive
examples and discussions of the functionality available in a
collection of function in an R library. Not all libraries have
vignettes, you can find a vignette for a library  by typing:

`vignette("Name of Library")`

in the R console

## Now you try:

1. Determine the mean value of the a vector below

```{r}

a <- c(2,4,8,3,5,4,1,3,8,NA,9,5,6,8,4,2,6,4,7,3,NA,5,6,7,8,3,9,1,12,14,100,0,NA)

```

2. Install the library `DT`, browse the documentation of the
`datatable`, look at the vignette. Then read in the dataset
"pigs_adg.csv" and make an html table of the entire dataframe using
the `datatable` function in that package.

It should look like this:

----

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(DT)
pig_adg<- read.csv("pig_adg.csv")

datatable(pig_adg)

```
