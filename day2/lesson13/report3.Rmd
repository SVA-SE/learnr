# Analysis of growth performance of pigs

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
pig_adg <- read.csv("pig_adg.csv")

boxplot(pig_adg$dtm ~ pig_adg$ar,
        ylab = "Days to market", col = "darkkhaki",
        xlab = "Atrophic Rhinitis score")

quantiles <- quantile(pig_adg$dtm, c(0, 0.05, 0.5, 0.95, 1))

```

## Results

The number of days to market (DTM) of the pigs in the current study
ranged from a minimum of `r quantiles["0%"]` to a maximum of
`r quantiles["100%"]`, the median DTM was `r quantiles["50%"]` days
