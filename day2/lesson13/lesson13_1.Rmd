# Communicating your findings in R - Create a report of your analysis results

## Background

When we analyze data and report our findings, most of use the
strategy of working with our data in a statistical software package
and saving a figure and then pasting that figure into a word document
to produce a report or a paper. When you are working in a programming
environment like R you have the opportunity to integrate your
analysis, and reporting of results into a seamless process so that if
you need to make a change to your original data after you already have
submitted a report then you can do that and immediately have a new
report that reflects the changes to the data. This is done by using a
typesetting language like LATEX or markdown to write your text and R
to do you data analysis. The markdown language is integrated with R
with the `rmarkdown` package.

The entire website that you are viewing right now was generated with
`rmarkdown`, so each of the chunks of the webpage that are R code were
run through the R software as the webpage was being built and the
figures and results were inserted. If you look at
[lesson6.1](../../day1/lesson6/lesson6_1.html) you can see under the
'Contingency table' section that the odds ratio and 95% confidence
intervals are in the text. These numbers were also calculated by R
during the building of the webpage.

A more elaborate example of this idea is [SVA's annual surveillance
report](http://www.sva.se/globalassets/redesign2011/pdf/om_sva/publikationer/surveillance2014.pdf). This
document was created with LATEX and R. All of the figures were
produced in `ggplot2` and the typesetting done with LATEX which allows
for fancier formatting that is not part of `rmarkdown`

The philosophy of markdown is to have a source document that is
readable and simple to edit on its own and have the ability to generate
several different outputs from this source material.

## Getting started

There are two basic components to an `rmarkdown` file:

1. `markdown`

    * This is essentially just text. You have some opportunities to
      format your text too. Look at [here learn about the
      markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


2. `R code`

    * The r-code is contained within two places in the document:
        * Chunks
        * Inline code

```{r, echo = FALSE}

rinline <- function(code){
  html <- '<code  class="r">``` `r CODE` ```</code>'
  sub("CODE", code, html)
}

```

### Chunks

Chunks are pieces of the r markdown file that are bound by 3 backticks
on their own lines like this:

<pre><code>```{r}

 #Some R code

```</code></pre>

### Inline code

Inline code allows you to call a value from an r object right in your
text. It is also bound by a single backtick, like this:

A sentence with `r rinline("# Some R code")` in the middle.

R-studio has a nice
[cheatsheet for rmarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
to remind you of the syntax for the R code and markdown in the file.

## A Basic R-markdown report

To generate an r-markdown report you can start in R-studio by
selecting

* File
    * New file
        * R markdown...

Give it a name (my_report maybe?) and leave the rest alone.

Now you will have a file named 'Untitled.Rmd'. '.Rmd' is the extension
for rmarkdown files.

If you click the Knit HTML button at the top of the window, R renders
the '.Rmd' to a web page and the page pops up in a browser window.

If you save the .Rmd as 'my__report.Rmd' then you will also get the
file 'my_report.html' back in the same directory as the rmarkdown
file. This is the file that you can distribute as your report.

## A custom report

Here we will create a report with some of the analysis that we have
done on the 'pig_adg' dataset.

Start by creating a new .Rmd file with the following content:

[Run this chunk](report1.html)
<pre><code># Analysis of growth performance of pigs
</code>
<code>```{r}

library(ggplot2)
pig_adg <- read.csv("pig_adg.csv")

boxplot(pig_adg$dtm ~ pig_adg$ar,
        ylab = "Days to market", col = "darkkhaki",
        xlab = "Atrophic Rhinitis score")
```</code></pre>


There are some parts of the analysis that we want to show and other
parts that we want to complete but not show the results of. In the
example above, we want to see the title and the plot but not the code
that was used to produce the plot. To hide this part we add an argument to the chunk inside the {brackets} and after the 'r' like this:

[Run this chunk](report2.html)
<pre><code># Analysis of growth performance of pigs
</code>
<code>```{r<font color="red"><b>, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE</b></font>}

library(ggplot2)
pig_adg <- read.csv("pig_adg.csv")

boxplot(pig_adg$dtm ~ pig_adg$ar,
        ylab = "Days to market", col = "darkkhaki",
        xlab = "Atrophic Rhinitis score")
```</code></pre>

You can use this strategy in a report to do you analysis in the
background and just let the reader see your pretty figures. You may
also want to extract numbers from your analysis that you want to use
in paragraph text. You can do this by completing an analysis inside a
chunk and then calling the result in 'inline' code. Like this:

[Run this chunk](report3.html)
<pre><code># Analysis of growth performance of pigs
</code>
<code>```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}</code>

library(ggplot2)
pig_adg <- read.csv("pig_adg.csv")

boxplot(pig_adg$dtm ~ pig_adg$ar,
        ylab = "Days to market", col = "darkkhaki",
        xlab = "Atrophic Rhinitis score")</code>

<code><font color="red"><b>quantiles <- quantile(pig_adg$dtm, c(0, 0.05, 0.5, 0.95, 1))</b></font>

```</code>

<code>## Results</code>

<code>The number of days to market (DTM) of the pigs in the current study</code>
<code>ranged from a minimum of <font color="red"><b><code>`r</code> <code>quantiles</code><code>["0%"]`</code></b></font> to a maximum of</code>
<font color="red"><b><code><code>`r</code> <code>quantiles</code><code>["100%"]`</code></b></font>, the median DTM was <font color="red"><b><code>`r</code> <code>quantiles</code><code>["50%"]`</code></b></font> days</code>

</pre>


Now you can see the idea, that essentially any number or figure that
you can get from R, you can include in an R-markdown report. To
illustrate the principle that the individual chunks of R code in the
report are connected, we'll add last feature of a table in another
chunk that uses the data that we read into R in the first chunk:

[Run this chunk](report4.html)
<pre><code># Analysis of growth performance of pigs
</code>
<code>```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}</code>

library(ggplot2)
pig_adg <- read.csv("pig_adg.csv")

boxplot(pig_adg$dtm ~ pig_adg$ar,
        ylab = "Days to market", col = "darkkhaki",
        xlab = "Atrophic Rhinitis score")</code>

<code>quantiles <- quantile(pig_adg$dtm, c(0, 0.05, 0.5, 0.95, 1))

```</code>

<code>## Results</code>

<code>The number of days to market (DTM) of the pigs in the current study</code>
<code>ranged from a minimum of <code>`r</code> <code>quantiles</code><code>["0%"]`</code> to a maximum of</code>
<code><code>`r</code> <code>quantiles</code><code>["100%"]`</code>, the median DTM was <code>`r</code> <code>quantiles</code><code>["50%"]`</code> days</code>

<font color="red"><b>
<code>```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}</code>

<code>library(DT)

datatable(pig_adg[,c("farm","dtm", "ar")], options = list(pageLength = 10))

```</code>
</b></font>
</pre>


So here we used the object `pig_adg` in the second chunk without having to read it back in.


## Now you try

Create you own report on an summary of the "pig_adg.csv" dataset. You
can copy the code from the last example into a .Rmd file or start
again from nothing if you like.

* Try adding some paragraph text in between the chunks of R code.
* Add another figure to the report, you decide what you would like
* Add some inline code
