# Communicating your findings in R - Create a report of your analysis results

## Background

When we analyze data and report our findings, most of use the
strategy of working with our data in a statistical software package
and saving a figure and then pasting that figure into a word document
to produce a report or a paper. When you are working in a programming
environment like R you have the opportunity to integrate your
analysis, and reporting of results into a seamless process so that if
you need to make a change to your original data after you already have
submitted a report then you can do that and immediately have a new
report that reflects the changes to the data. This is done by using a
typesetting language like LATEX or markdown to write your text and R
to do you data analysis. The markdown language is integrated with R
with the `rmarkdown` package.

The entire website that you are viewing right now was generated with
`rmarkdown`, so each of the chucks of th webpages that are R code were
run through the R software as the webpage was being built and the
figures and results were inserted. If you look at
[lesson6.1](../../day1/lesson6/lesson6_1.html) you can see under the
'Contingency table' section that the odds ratio and 95% confidence
intervals are in the text. These numbers were also calculated by R
during the building of the webpage.

A more elaborate example of this idea is [SVA's annual surveillance
report](http://www.sva.se/globalassets/redesign2011/pdf/om_sva/publikationer/surveillance2014.pdf). This
document was created with LATEX and R. All of the figures were
produced in `ggplot2` and the typesetting done with LATEX which allows
for fancier formatting that is not part of `rmarkdown`

The philosophy of markdown is to have a source document that is
readable and simple to edit on its own and have the ability to generate
several different outputs from this source material.

## Getting started

There are two basic components to an `rmarkdown` file:

1. `markdown`

    * This is essentially just text. You have some opportunities to
      format your text too. Look at [here learn about the
      markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)


2. `R code`

    * The r-code is contained within two places in the document:
        * Chunks
        * Inline code

```{r, echo = FALSE}

rinline <- function(code){
  html <- '<code  class="r">``` `r CODE` ```</code>'
  sub("CODE", code, html)
}

```

### Chunks

Chunks are pieces of the r markdown file that are bound by 3 backticks
on their own lines like this:

<pre><code>```{r}

 #Some R code

```</code></pre>

### Inline code

Inline code allows you to call a value from an r object right in your
text. It is also bound by a single backtick, like this:

A sentence with `r rinline("# Some R code")` in the middle.

R-studio has a nice
[cheatsheet for rmarkdown](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
to remind you of the syntax for the R code and markdown in the file.

## A Basic R-markdown report

To generate an r-markdown report you can start in R-studio by
selecting

* File
    * New file
        * R markdown...

Give it a name (my_report maybe?) and leave the rest alone.

Now you will have a file named 'Untitled.Rmd'. '.Rmd' is the extension
for rmarkdown files.

If you click the Knit HTML button at the top of the window, R renders
the '.Rmd' to a web page and the page pops up in a browser window.

If you save the .Rmd as 'my__report.Rmd' then you will also get the
file 'my_report.html' back in the same directory as the rmarkdown
file. This is the file that you can distribute as your report.
