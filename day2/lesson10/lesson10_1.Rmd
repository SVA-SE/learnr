# How to find and use R extensions (packages)

R extensions (called packages or libraries) are available to you right
in R studio. As we have done early in the course material we can
install a package in R-studio as well as load a package into the
current working environment. Let's first just assume that you don't
have R-studio to help you with this. Then you would install a package
like this:

```{r, comment = NA, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("EpiContactTrace")

```

R asks you during this process from which server you would like to
download the package. Usually you can just pick the first one. After
you have installed the package you need to load the package, there's a
button for this in R studio but again if you just have R then you do
the following:

```{r, comment = NA, eval = FALSE}

library("EpiContactTrace")

```

R packages are extensions to the base functionality of R. A Package is
a group of functions that are written by a developer and bundled in a
way that you can install and use them easily in R. If you a STATA
user, then R packages are analogous to the STATA ".ado" packages that
are available when you run FINDIT in STATA.

When you install a package in R-studio using the buttons you will
notice that one of the drop down boxes asks you from where you would
like to install the package. "Repository (CRAN)" is the first
choice. CRAN is a collection of R packages written and maintained by
your colleagues. It is not the only place that you can get R
packages. Two other common sources of R packages are "Bioconductor"
and "GitHub". Bioconductor has many packages that focus on Ecology and
genetics and like CRAN is a source of packages that you can easily
install with the method above. On GitHub, you may find R-packages that
are under development and have not yet been submitted to CRAN or fully
developed work, however these packages may require a build process to
use that can be slightly more involved than sourcing from CRAN.

Today there are approximately 7000 packages available on CRAN alone,
so you may wonder where to start when determining what you need to
solve your problem. Again if you are a STATA user you would probably
start with the manuals. The 'manuals' for R are much more extensive,
accessible but also distributed than the STATA manuals. The R manuals
are the sum of the documentation of all of the functions of R and its
packages as well as the body of knowledge in scientific publications,
online forums and books written about R. Because of the distributed
and open nature of the R ecosystem, you need to search the internet
for resources.

* R Task-View
    * This is a set of themes or classifications of analysis,
      datamanagment, visualization and others, in which many R
      packages listed on CRAN are categorized. This will give you a
      starting point to explore packages that are in a theme that you
      need.
* R-bloggers
    * This is a syndication of blogs from the web that are about the
      use of R. Often you will find small examples of tasks completed
      with new or existing packages or solutions to problems that
      someone would like to illustrate.
* Stack-Overflow
    * This is a great resource of questions, answers and discussion of
      likely every problem that you will encounter. You can also
      submit your own questions to Stack-Overflow and often a member
      of the community will give you suggestions very quickly.

## Now you try

* Have a look at R task View, R bloggers, and Stackoverflow.

* Try to find a package that solves a problem in your work, can you find any good examples on R bloggers?

* What do you find with a google search on you subject?
