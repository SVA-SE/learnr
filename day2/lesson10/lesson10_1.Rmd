# How to find and use R extensions (packages)

R extensions are available to you right in R studio. As we have done
early in the course material we can install a package in R-studio as
well as load a package into the current working environment. Let's
first just assume that you don't have R-studio to help you with
this. Then you would install a package like this:

```{r, comment = NA, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("EpiContactTrace")

```

R asks you during this process from which server you would like to
download the package. Usually you can just pick the first one.
