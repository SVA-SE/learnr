# Install a package

Installing a package in R-Studio from CRAN only requires that you have
an internet connection and that you choose 'Packages' in the bottom
right pane followed by 'install-packages'. Type the name of the
package that you would like to install in the name of package
field. Click 'Install'

If you wish to install a package from Github then often the Github
page associated with the project will have instructions about how to
install the package. The process is to **"install an R package from
source"** and may require installation of some other tools that just R
and R studio.
