# Introduction to R and the RStudio editor
    1.  Make sure everyone has the correct software
    2.  How to enter commands in R
    3.  Comparison of an R-script and a do-file

# Get Software

Before the workshop, we need to make sure everyone has a recent version
of the R software package and the R-Studio editor. To evaluate R code on a
computer all you need is R itself; to make the experience easy,
having a software that talks to R for you makes everything much
easier. You can find several editors that work with R, but for this
workshop we have chosen the very popular R-Studio environment.

	1.  Go to the
        [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
