# Generating new variables

```{r set-options, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
options(width = 100)
```

```{r}
# Read data from file 'herd_20.txt'
herd_20 <- read.table("herd_20.txt", header = TRUE)

# View a summary of the dataset
summary(herd_20)

# View the first six rows of the dataset
head(herd_20)

# View the structure of the dataset
str(herd_20)
```
And of course you can use

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(herd_20)
```

Let's add a column with the name of the herd manager

```{r}
herd_20$manager <- "Alice"

# View the structure of the dataset again
str(herd_20)

# View the first six rows of the dataset
head(herd_20)
```

You will notice that the herd manager value "Alice" has been added to all of
the rows of the dataframe in the column named `manager`

The variable that we added now was only one value and the same value
for all rows in the dataframe. Perhaps we need to generate a new
variable based on the values of the other variables in the dataframe.

Often when you are modeling you need to generate a squared term of a
variable to test its effect on an outcome. Let's generate a new
variable that is the square of litter size `lsize`

```{r}

herd_20$lsize_sq <- herd_20$lsize ^ 2

```

And then have a look at just a small piece of the dataframe to confirm
that what we did makes sense

```{r}

head(herd_20[,c("herd", "lsize", "lsize_sq")])

```

Suppose we want to create a new variable based on the value of two
other variables. We'll generate the percent preweaning mortality for
this farm

```{r}

herd_20$percent_mort <- herd_20$dead / herd_20$lsize

```

Then have a look at a little piece of the dataframe to make sure what
we did make sense

```{r}

head(herd_20[,c("herd", "dead", "lsize", "percent_mort")])

```

It seems that we forgot to multiply by 100 to get the percent. We
can do two things to fix this:

* Multiply the preweaning mortality variable by 100 and replace it.
* Recreate the preweaning mortality and replace the incorrect variable.

We'll try both. First multiply the `percent_mort` variable by 100 and replace it

```{r}

herd_20$percent_mort <- herd_20$percent_mort * 100
head(herd_20[,c("herd", "dead", "lsize", "percent_mort")])

```

Notice that it is OK to use a variable and replace it at the same
time. But we could have also calculated the variable again from the
`dead` and `lsize` variable:

```{r}

herd_20$percent_mort <- (herd_20$dead / herd_20$lsize) * 100

```

## Now you try

Generate a new variable for the percent stillborn piglets per
litter. Then round the result to one decimal place. To do the rounding
use the `round` function, it takes two arguments, the variable and the
number of decimal places.
