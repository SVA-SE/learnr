# Merging

Merging data is a very common task. In contrast to appending data
where all of the variables are the same, when you merge data only one
of the variables in the two datasets needs to be the same
variable. This variable is called the 'key' and is means of
identifying observations in the dataset. This 'key' may be unique like
an animal identifier or may identify groups like a herd identifier. In
the preweaning mortality dataset that we have been working with there
is no single variable that uniquely identifies a single observation
because sows can be in the dataset more then once over several
parities. In this dataset the 'key' the individual observations at the
litter level would be a combination of `sowid` and `litter`.

The example that we will work on will be adding a new variable that we
have in another dataset that was recorded at the herd level. You might
have information about management factors, herd size, location
recorded at that level and you wish to merge it to your litter level
information in order to complete a multi-level analysis.

To merge data is a 2 step process of matching and then applying the
new values to the matched locations, called indexes.

First we will read in and have a look at the datasets:

```{r, comment = NA}

prewmort <- read.csv("prewmort.csv")

herd_level <- read.csv("farm_level.csv")

herd_level

```

You can see that we have a number of variables in the dataset that we
might like in our litter level dataset. We will merge the
`nsow`variable which is the number of sows in the farm; and the
`coli_vac` variable which is whether or not the herd uses an *E. coli*
vaccine. Lets explore the `match` function on something a little
smaller before we use it to match the `herd` variable between the two
datasets above.

Here is a vector (A vector is a sequence of something like a variable
in a dataframe) of words.

```{r, comment = NA}

cattle <- c("Angus", "Hereford", "Holstein", "Charolais", "Shorthorn", "Jersey")

my_cows <- c("Hereford", "Shorthorn")

match(my_cows, cattle)
```

The match function gives the indexes of the first argument in the
second. So you get 2 because "Hereford" (The first element of the
`my_cows` vector) is the second element in the `cattle` vector and 5
because "Shorthorn"(The second element of the `my_cows` vector) is the
5^th^ element in the `cattle` vector

Lets flip the arguments and see what we get back:

```{r, comment = NA}

match(cattle, my_cows)

```

Now look at the elements of the `cattle` vector.

* The first ("Angus") is not in the `my_cows` vector and so you get
  `NA`
* The second ("Hereford") is in position 1 of the `my_cows` vector so
  you get 1
* The third and fourth ("Holstein" and "Charolais") are not in the
  `my_cows` vector so you get `NA NA`
* The fifth ("Shorthorn") is in position 2 of the `my_cows` vector so
  you a 2
* The sixth ("Jersey") is not in the `my_cows` vector so you get `NA`

The indices of the matches are the map that you will use to merge your
data. Let's try matching the `herd` variable in the `prewmort`
dataframe to the `herd` variable in the `herd_level` dataset. The
logic here is that we want to know the index in the herd level data
for each litter in the litter level dataset.

```{r, comment = NA}

index <- match(prewmort$herd, herd_level$herd)

head(index)
```

Now we generate a new variable in the `prewmort` with the ecoli
vaccination of the herd from the herd_level dataset

```{r, comment = NA}

prewmort$vaccine <- herd_level$coli_vac[index]
head(prewmort)

```

## Now you try

Create a new variable in the `prewmort` dataset for the number of sows in the farm. The data you need is in a file named "herd_size.csv".

1. Read in the "herd_size.csv" file
2. generate an index by matching
3. Create a new variable and use you index to get the correct values where they belong
