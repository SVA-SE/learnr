# Merging

Merging data is a very common task. In contrast to appending data
where all of the variables are the same, when you merge data only one
of the variables in the two datasets needs to be the same
variable. This variable is called the 'key' and is means of
identifying observations in the dataset. This 'key' may be unique like
an animal identifier or may identify groups like a herd identifier. In
the preweaning mortality dataset that we have been working with there
is no single variable that uniquely identifies a single observation
because sows can be in the dataset more then once over several
parities. In this dataset the 'key' the individual observations at the
litter level would be a combination of `sowid` and `litter`.

The example that we will work on will be adding a new variable that we
have in another dataset that was recorded at the herd level. You might
have information about management factors, herd size, location
recorded at that level and you wish to merge it to your litter level
information in order to complete a multi-level analysis.

To merge data is a 2 step process of matching and then applying the
new values to the matched locations, called indexes.

First we will read in and have a look at the datasets:

```{r}

prewmort <- read.csv("prewmort.csv")

herd_level <- read.csv("farm_level.csv")

herd_level

```
