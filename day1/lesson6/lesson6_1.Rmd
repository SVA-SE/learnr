# Work through examples from [Veterinary Epidemiologic Research](http://www.upei.ca/ver/) in R.

We will work through the examples from the chapter on 'Mixed models for
discrete data' (Pages 579-606) in the 2nd edition of the
[Veterinary Epidemiologic Research](http://www.upei.ca/ver/)
textbook. If you have the first edition of the same book the examples
are almost the same and are on pages 499-520.
