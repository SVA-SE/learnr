# Leaflet

You can also create interactive maps that support panning, zooming and
annotations. The `leaflet` R package uses the JavaScript
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) library under the hood.


You can read more about this method here:
http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/

## Point map

The point map of some farms and add a colour to the points based on a
variable in a dataframe. We have the x, y locations of the farms as
well as the other covariate information stored in the same dataframe.

```{r, comment = NA}
library(leaflet)

## Read farm data
farms <- read.csv("farm_level.csv")

## Create leaflet map
map <- leaflet()
map <- addTiles(map)
map <- addCircleMarkers(map,
                        lng   = farms$long,
                        lat   = farms$lat,
                        popup = paste("Herd id: ", farms$herd),
                        color = ifelse(farms$coli_vac == 1, "green", "red"),
                        fill  = TRUE)

## Plot

# Create a choropleth



For this demonstration we'll use a map (shapefile) that we downloaded
from Eurostat (Â© EuroGeographics for the administrative boundaries)
http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units

We have extracted the Swedish NUTS 2 level (Nomenclature of
Territorial Units for Statistics) and added the Swedish name for each
region. The format of the data that we load in "Sweden.RData" is a
called a "Spatial polygon dataframe" and is the R equivalent to a
shapefile.

```{r, comment = NA}
library(leaflet)

## Load the map over Sweden
load("Sweden.RData")

## Create a means to generate colour levels.
pal <- colorQuantile("YlGn", NULL, n = 5)

## Create choropleth that colors each region by the size of the region.

map <- leaflet(Sweden)
map <- addTiles(map)
map <- addPolygons(map,
                   fillColor = ~pal(Sweden@data$SHAPE_Area),
                   stroke = FALSE,
                   fillOpacity = 0.5,
                   smoothFactor = 0.5,
                   popup = Sweden@data$Region)

## Plot map
map
```
In the example above we use the Area of the polygon as an example of a number that could affect the colour of the polygon in the map. You could merge any data that you have at the region level into you spatial polygon dataframe and use that information as your `fillColor` argument.
