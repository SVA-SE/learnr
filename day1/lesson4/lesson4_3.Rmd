# Subsetting data in R

Subsetting data in R tends to be a tricky concept to grasp for
newcomers to R. However, understanding at least how to subset a data
frame is fundamental to understanding how to modify your data or select
just some of your larger dataset. We did some subsetting already in
the previous examples by calling a variable within a dataframe using
the 'Dollar sign' **\$**. Now we will discuss that and more.

First read in the data as we have been doing at the beginning of each
lesson. We'll use a smaller dataset this time that just contains one
herd.

```{r set-options, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
options(width = 100)
```

```{r}

my_data <- read.table("herd_20_snippet.txt", header = TRUE)

```

Now let's select just one of the variables in the dataset and ask to
see it

```{r}

my_data$lsize

```

You will see a sequence of numbers in the console. What we did
was ask to see the contents of the 'lsize' variable in the
'my\_data' data frame. We returned one of the columns in the data
frame. We did this earlier as well when we tabulated and summarized
the contents of variables in the dataset, but we never really looked
as the sequence of numbers that we were passing to the functions to do
tabulation and summarizing. You could do the same thing for any of the
variables in the data frame.

Above we refer to the name of the variable in the data frame. We can
also refer to rows and columns in the data frame by their numerical
order called their 'index'. When you do this you no longer use the
**\$** operator but two square brackets, **[]**, after the name of the
data frame. Inside these brackets you put the indexes of the rows and
columns that you want back from the data frame separated by a comma.

```{r}

## mydata[row, column]
my_data[1,1]

```

We asked for the first row and first column in the data frame. Check
to make sure that makes sense by using the `View` function to look at
your data and check the value of the first row, first column.

If you leave one of the two indexes blank R interprets this as wanted
all of the values. Therefore, if you were to do the following

```{r, width = 100}

my_data[,]

```

R returns to you the entire data frame. If we use this principle, we
can ask for an entire row or entire column in the dataframe

```{r}

## the first row
my_data[1,]

## the first column
my_data[,1]

```

You can also supply a series of numbers, which in R is called a
'vector', to the index in order to retrieve several columns or rows at
a time. For example the first 3 rows:

```{r}

## generate a vector of 1 to 3
a <- c(1,2,3)

## This is what your vector looks like
a

## use this vector to index your dataframe
my_data[a,]

```

You should see the first 3 rows of your data frame.


In the above example we give the numeric index of the rows in the data
frame. We can also subset a dataset with a vector of TRUES and FALSES
that has the same length as the number of rows or columns in the
dataset. The data frame that we are working with has 9 rows.

```{r}


## generate a vector of 3 TRUES and 6 FALSES (Because we have 9 rows)
a <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)

## This is what your vector looks like
a

## use this vector to index your dataframe
my_data[a,]



```

Note that we get the same result indexing this way as we did when we
indexed numerically. The vector of TRUE and FALSE was used to choose
the rows that we want with TRUE and eliminate the rows we don't want
with FALSE.

All of this may seem abstract, but it is a very powerful foundation
for selecting subsections of your data for further analysis. Let's say
we want to examine only the litters that have preweaning mortality. We
have the variable 'lmort' so we can use that to determine the
indexes of the rows of the data frame that we want.

```{r}

## Create the indexing vector

a <- my_data$lmort == 1

## Examine the vector

a

## Now use it to index the rows of the dataframe

my_data[a,]

```

In the above we used a logical operator `==` to test if the values in
the 'lmort' variable are exactly equal to 1. You could perform other
tests using a variety of
[logical operators](http://www.statmethods.net/management/operators.html).


Let's read in the larger dataset that we worked with before for
all the farms and try to use the subsetting principles to do something
practical:

```{r}

my_data <- read.csv("prewmort.csv")

```

Now we'll create a cross-tabulation of sow_parity and preweaning
mortality for just 1990.

```{r}

## Generate a new dataset with just row where the year is 1990

a <- my_data$year == 1990

my_data_1990 <- my_data[a,]

table(my_data_1990$lmort, my_data_1990$sow_parity)

```

## Now you try

Determine which of herds 37 and 34 have the highest mean sow
parity. You'll need to subset your data and use the `summary` function.
