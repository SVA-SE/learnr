# Summarizing data in R

Summarizing data means exploring your data in...

* Read in data from comma separated format to a dataframe named
  'my_data'.

```{r}

my_data <- read.csv("prewmort.csv")

```

* Use the 'str' function to examine the dataframe. This gives you
  information about the names of the variables in the dataset and the
  types of data that are in each variable.

```{r}

str(my_data)

```

* Now you can summarize variables in the dataframe. Let's start with a
  continuous variable. The 'summary' function on the 'lsize' (litter
  size) variable in the 'my_data' dataframe returns the minimum,
  maximum, some percentiles and the mean.

```{r}

summary(my_data$lsize)

```

* If you are summarizing a variable that is categorical like
'herdtype' then 'summary' will not help you at first:

```{r}
summary(my_data$herdtype)
```

* If you go back and look at the structure of the 'my_data' dataframe,
you'll see that each of the variables in the dataframe has a
data type. In this case they are all: 'int' (integers). When you ask R
to summarize a numeric variable like an integer then it does what it
thinks is sensible and returns percentiles and mean. If we let R know
that the variable we are dealing with is a categorical variable, known
in R as a 'factor', then it will give us a more useful summary of the
data.

```{r}

my_data$herdtype <- factor(my_data$herdtype,
                           levels = c(0,1),
                           labels = c("production", "breeding"))

summary(my_data$herdtype)

```

* You may notice a few things in the code above. We are assigning
  values to the 'herdtype' variable in the 'my_data' dataframe using
  the '<-' arrow. In this case we are replacing existing values. We
  are using a function: 'factor'. This function has 3 arguments
	  1. The values (The existing content of the 'herdtype' variable)
	  2. The levels (These are the unique levels in the categorical
         variable)
	  3. The labels (These are the names of the levels. See the
  [description of the dataset](../../about_datasets.html))
  The arguments in the function are separated by commas and the line
  breaks do not matter. You can add line breaks anywhere you wish to
  make your script more readable without really long lines.


## Now you try

Summarize the sow parity.

1. In the description of the data we do not know if gilts are coded as
   parity 0 or parity 1. Can we determine that from the data?

2. Plot a histogram of the frequency of sow parities in the data. The
   function for histogram is 'hist'
