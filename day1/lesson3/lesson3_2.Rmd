# What types of data can you store in a data.frame

As we mentioned in the previous lesson a data.frame is a collection of
different variables. These variables are called "vectors" in R and a
data.frame is a `list` of vectors that each has a name. The data.frame
allows you to store:

* Numbers:

```{r, comment = NA}

c(1,2,3,4)

```

* Characters:


```{r, comment = NA}

c("apples", "oranges", "bananas", "kiwi")

```

* Logical:

```{r, comment = NA}

c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)

```

* A Categorical variable called a Factor

```{r, comment = NA}

factor(c("apples", "oranges", "bananas", "kiwi"))

```

The previous data.frames that we read contained only numeric
values. Let's read in a .csv file that has both numeric and character
values.

```{r, comment = NA}

fruits <- read.csv("fruits.csv")

fruits

str(fruits)

```

You notice that we have two different data types here. `n` is a 'int'
which is short for integer and is one of the numeric datatypes in
R. `fruit` is a factor. R converted the character string in the csv
file to a factor as it was imported. If you don' want that then do
this:

```{r, comment = NA}

fruits <- read.csv("fruits.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

str(fruits)

```

Now we have a numeric and a 'chr' short for character. We can create a
logical variable as well. We will come back to the details of how to
create new variables in a data.frame in a later lesson.


```{r, comment = NA}

fruits$delicious <- c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)

fruits
str(fruits)
```

So now we can see which fruits that I prefer and the other data type 'logi' which is short for logical.
