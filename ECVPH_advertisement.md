# Introduction to R!

## Learning objectives

This course will teach you the basics of data management and analysis
in R. We will teach the following concepts:

* What is data in R? Why isn't it just a spreadsheet like in Stata?
    * Dataframes, vectors, lists and more!
* How to open data in R from other software
    * Stata, SAS, excel, .csv
* Basic data cleaning and manipulation
    * Merging, appending
	* corrections to data
	* Generating new variables in a dataset
* Implementing and interpreting the output from basic statistical
tests and models in R.
* Plotting in R
	* Generating plots using base plotting and ggplot2
	* Demonstration of mapping in R, point maps, riskmaps,
      spatiotemporal map animation

## Prerequisites

Interest in learning to use R! We will use examples that are related
to data summary, analysis and plotting in veterinary
epidemiology. Therefore we expect that you have a knowledge of basic
statistics.

Participants need to bring their own laptop with the latest version of
[R](http://www.r-project.org/) (http://www.r-project.org/)
installed. The participants also need to install the
[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/) editor (http://www.rstudio.com/).

## Target audience

You are a person with an interest in data management and data analysis.

We expect that you have either little or no experience with R.

This course is for epidemiologists and students in epidemiology that
would like to incorporate R into their work.

## Biography of Instructor

Dr. Thomas Rosendal is an epidemiologist working at the
[National Veterinary Institute](www.sva.se), Sweden. Thomas has a PhD
in epidemiology from the University of Guelph in Canada and has had a
focus on analytical epidemiology in his work. Thomas has been a Stata
user for many years.  He has a specific interest in data
visualization, which led to a switch to R three years ago to take
advantage of its powerful plotting functionality. Today he uses R for
all his data analysis, visualization and reporting.

## History of workshop

This workshop was given in 2016 at ISVEE-Mexico.
