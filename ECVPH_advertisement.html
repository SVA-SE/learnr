<h1 id="introduction-to-r">Introduction to R!</h1>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p>This course will teach you the basics of data management and analysis in R. We will teach the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is data in R? Why isn't it just a spreadsheet like in Stata?
<ul>
<li>Dataframes, vectors, lists and more!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How to open data in R from other software
<ul>
<li>Stata, SAS, excel, .csv</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Basic data cleaning and manipulation
<ul>
<li>Merging, appending</li>
<li>corrections to data</li>
<li>Generating new variables in a dataset</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Implementing and interpreting the output from basic statistical tests and models in R.</li>
<li>Plotting in R
<ul>
<li>Generating plots using base plotting and ggplot2</li>
<li>Demonstration of mapping in R, point maps, riskmaps, spatiotemporal map animation</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Interest in learning to use R! We will use examples that are related to data summary, analysis and plotting in veterinary epidemiology. Therefore we expect that you have a knowledge of basic statistics.</p>
<p>Participants need to bring their own laptop with the latest version of <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> (http://www.r-project.org/) installed. The participants also need to install the <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> editor (http://www.rstudio.com/).</p>
<h2 id="target-audience">Target audience</h2>
<p>You are a person with an interest in data management and data analysis.</p>
<p>We expect that you have either little or no experience with R.</p>
<p>This course is for epidemiologists and students in epidemiology that would like to incorporate R into their work.</p>
<h2 id="biography-of-instructor">Biography of Instructor</h2>
<p>Dr. Thomas Rosendal is an epidemiologist working at the <a href="www.sva.se">National Veterinary Institute</a>, Sweden. Thomas has a PhD in epidemiology from the University of Guelph in Canada and has had a focus on analytical epidemiology in his work. Thomas has been a Stata user for many years. He has a specific interest in data visualization, which led to a switch to R three years ago to take advantage of its powerful plotting functionality. Today he uses R for all his data analysis, visualization and reporting.</p>
