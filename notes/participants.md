What: ISVEE 2015
When: Nov 1st and 2nd 2015.
Who: The course was taught by Stefan Widgren
	and Thomas Rosendal and the participants were:

	Chenais Erika <erika.chenais@sva.se>;
	Jenny Stavisky <Jenny.Stavisky@nottingham.ac.uk>;
	Mark Bosson <mark.bosson@ospri.co.nz>;
	Ashley Hill <aehill@ucdavis.edu>;
	Tiziana Lembo <tiziana.lembo@glasgow.ac.uk>;
	Anke Wiethoelter <anke.wiethoelter@sydney.edu.au>;

The course material was generally speaking fine. It could be good to
consider giving the students more time to work on their own with tasks
in order to get them to learn to make mistakes and not just copy
code. However on the first day you need to cover a lot of material in
order to make the next steps make any sense.
