What: ISVEE 2015
When: Nov 1st and 2nd 2015.

	and Thomas Rosendal and the participants were:

	Chenais Erika <erika.chenais@sva.se>;
	Jenny Stavisky <Jenny.Stavisky@nottingham.ac.uk>;
	Mark Bosson <mark.bosson@ospri.co.nz>;

	Tiziana Lembo <tiziana.lembo@glasgow.ac.uk>;
	Anke Wiethoelter <anke.wiethoelter@sydney.edu.au>;

The course material was generally speaking fine. It could be good to
consider giving the students more time to work on their own with tasks
in order to get them to learn to make mistakes and not just copy
code. However on the first day you need to cover a lot of material in
order to make the next steps make any sense.

Finances: The students paid 3300 USD (500 per student (3 persons), 600
for regular delegates (3 persons)). The conference took 43 USD per
participant (6 persons) and 116 USD per person (8 persons) for food
and 200 USD for the projector. Total expenses, 1386 USD. We should
receive 1914 USD from ISVEE.
