Here are a few sites that we talked about during the discussion on
finding resources to help you with R in the future:

[R bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/) - A syndication of many other
blog posts that are themed about R. 


[http://www.springer.com/series/6991?detailsPage=titles](Springer book series on R)

[https://www.crcpress.com/Chapman--HallCRC-The-R-Series/book-series/CRCTHERSER](Chapman book series on R)


[www.github.com](GitHub) - A code sharing web repository for all things open source. Here you will find some R packages that are not available from CRAN

If you wish to install packages from github then you need a toolset called 'Rtools'.



[https://www.bioconductor.org/](Bioconductor) - A resource for Ecology and genetics tools for R
